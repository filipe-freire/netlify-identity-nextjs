[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/250b49da-80d5-4260-8b03-806184a1f547/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/identity-nextjs-integration-demo/deploys)

This project aims to demonstrate a possible implementation of Netlify Identity's auth solution. A mock Photo Gallery was built in NextJS to show the concept, where the user can only see the photos upon sign up.
